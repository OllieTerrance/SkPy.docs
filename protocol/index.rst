Skype protocol
==============

This page hopes to provide an unofficial documentation for interacting with the Skype HTTP APIs.

.. warning::
    Most of the information here is a combination of guesswork, and analysis of Skype for Web.  There is no official documentation, and therefore no guarantee that the definitions below are accurate or complete.

    There are also several cases where the parameters listed have a value and no further explanation.  If the behaviour is unknown, these may just be copied from requests made by Skype for Web, and have been replicated in SkPy too.
