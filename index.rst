Here you will find the documentation for `SkPy <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/SkPy>`_, an unofficial Python library for interacting with the Skype HTTP API.

Here be dragons
---------------

The upstream APIs used here are undocumented and are liable to change, which may cause parts of this library to fall apart in obvious or non-obvious ways.  You have been warned.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.6+ (includes 3.x)
- `BeautifulSoup <http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/>`_
- `Requests <http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/>`_ [1]_
- `Responses <https://github.com/getsentry/responses>`_ (for tests)

.. [1] Note that Requests no longer supports Python 3.2 -- the last working version is 2.10.0.

Contributing
------------

Take a look at the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/OllieTerrance/SkPy>`_ for how to get involved.
